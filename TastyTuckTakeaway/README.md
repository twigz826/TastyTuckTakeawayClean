 Welcome to the tastiest tuck you're ever going to find in Bedford.

 We have a delicious range of traditional Chinese dishes cooked to perfection by our chefs.

 To place an order, run the app. Follow the instructions to add items to your cart, checkout and then enjoy the taste of true perfection.


Project Purpose
==================
This app will be used for a Clean Code workshop presented to new graduates. I will be muddying the app in a separate project and asking the graduates to identify code smells and fix them.


Running the App
==================
Before running the app, you will need to configure a throwaway gmail account which will be used to send verification/confirmation emails to the customer.

Once the gmail account is configured, you will need to enable 2 Step Verification and then add an app password.

In the EmailService, you will then see the names of the 2 environment variables that need to be configured (the email address and app password).

Once these are configured, run the app in visual studio and enjoy some tasty tuck!
